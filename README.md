## Project
<p align="justify">
Due to the fact that many houses do not have a maid or personal cleaner, the house cleaning service system has taken the effort to provide appropriate services to those who wish to spend less money while still receiving the necessary cleaning services. As a result, the approach saves money and eliminates the risk of hiring a full-time house cleaning.

Maintaining the house's cleanliness and tidiness takes time and effort. A strict work schedule and, on the other hand, makes it less possible for homeowners to keep their homes clean at all times. This problem inspires the idea of a ‘House Cleaning Service System.'
